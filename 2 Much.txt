Maybe I stare too much
Maybe not long enough
Funny how I forget to blink
But when you let down your hair
Dancin' like no one's there
I know I'm where I'm supposed to be
Say I love you under my breath
More times than you can digest
Music every time I hear your name (oh)
Your head's layin' right on my chest
Sun's up and I still ain't got no rest

Don't wanna close my eyes
I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep
I'd rather fall in love
When I can't feel you, I feel out of touch
Two seconds without you's like two months
Don't wanna close my eyes
I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep
I'd rather fall in love
'Cause eternity with you ain't long enough
Two seconds without you's like two months
And that's too much

Love the way you love your mom
Take on all your friends problems
Still somehow stop the world for us (oh)
I still relive that second
I met my biggest blessing
Prayed for you, look what God has done

I say I love you under my breath
More times than you could digest
Music every time I hear your name (oh)
Your head's laying right on my chest
Sun's up and I still ain't got no rest

Don't wanna close my eyes
I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep
I'd rather fall in love
When I can't feel you, I feel out of touch
Two seconds without you's like two months
Don't wanna close my eyes
I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep
I'd rather fall in love
'Cause eternity with you ain't long enough
Two seconds without you's like two months
And that's too much
