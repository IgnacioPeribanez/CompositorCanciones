This shit dicey
You entice me
What's your sign?
I'm a Pisces
Please, don't spite me 
Please, no fighting
I don't got energy 
Please, just hype me 
Bills on bills 
I want to make them 
All these hearts
I used to break them
But I've settled down
Yeah, I found the pocket
I hold the game
And I won't drop it

I feel funny
I feel funny
I feel funny
Laugh it up, chuckles
I feel funny
I feel funny
I feel funny
Laugh it up, chuckles
